# Hacker News Meets modern HTML

This is my hack on how I'd like to read the Hack News with a better html structure.

The idea is to try to reproduce the hacker news pages with semantic markup and proper css, maintaining its orginial look and feel.

Have a look at the code, I used:

- [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) as template engine
- [node-hnap, Unofficial Hacker News API](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi)
